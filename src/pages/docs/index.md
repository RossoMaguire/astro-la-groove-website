Welcome to the documentation for Shroud.email.

Shroud.email is a libre, open-source solution for email privacy. We recommend 
[signing up for the free trial](https://app.shroud.email/users/register) to try it out!

If you'd like to build something using our API, or if you'd like to self-host, this is the place for you.

All of our code is on [GitHub](https://github.com/Shroud-email/shroud.email) if you'd like to have a look around.
Contributions of all forms are very welcome!
